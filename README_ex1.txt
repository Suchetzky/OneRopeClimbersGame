README - One Rope Game

How we Divided the Work:
Everyone has a part in every aspect of the project.
But if we want to display the parts each person mostly worked on:

Programmers:
Yoni - Rock pool and snow particle effects, high bar, moving backround, music.
Tal - Character movment, swing, fall and connection with the rope. rope, clouds.

Designers:
both work on open, death and end scene.
Dafna - Backgrounds for the game, mountain and obstacle design,music.
Itamar - Character animation, design, rope design, camera control, Joystick controllers.

Difficulties in the Exercise:
1. It was challenging to decide which parts we needed to give up and which parts we wanted to keep.

2. It was challenging to work with a new group of people in a short amount of time,
especially when most of the exercise occurred during vacation times.
 
Feedback and Implementation:
1. We made the connection between characters clearer and more dependent of each other,
so if one falls, the other can't progress until they catch the mountain again.

2. After feedback about the snowstorm always being the same, we made the snow intensity vary according
to the height to create a more realistic climbing experience.

3. We adjusted the size of the lines and the open and end scenes to fit the game.

Playtest:
1. We received feedback about the difficulty of the stage and changed the rock appearance time accordingly.

2. We added another keyboard because it was challenging to play with two people on the same one.

3. More use for the swing - we didn't add a new feature specifically for using the swing, but it is necessary to avoid rocks quickly.
