# One Rope

"One Rope" is a cooperative game about two climbers connected by a rope as they navigate a treacherous snowy mountain.
Players must work together to strategize their ascent, carefully choosing paths and using swings to overcome obstacles like ice walls and roks.
Communication is key as they must coordinate their movements and support each other through the challenging climb. As they make their way to the top summit, they'll encounter changing weather conditions that add to the difficulty of the climb.
